####This is a Grade Calculator that the users could simply input their grades of assignments, project, quizzes, participation, and drag the exam seek bar to adjust their exam grades to calculate the final mark that they might be able to gain.

####Users could not input decimal numbers by directly input numbers start with "0.", If the users input the numbers start with "0.", the app will automatically convert the number that start with ".". For example, if you want to input 0.85 into the Edit Text box, the app will convert the number into .85.

####Users could not input the number that is larger than 100, if the user input a number that is larger than 100. The app will clear all data in the Edit Text box, and a hint will be shown that "ENTER from 0 - 100" at the same time.
